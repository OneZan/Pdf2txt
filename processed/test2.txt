5
collectively 66 Defendants'), and DOES 1-20, and with knowledge as to himself and otherwise on
6
information and belief, claims and alleges as follows: NNTRODUCTION
8
1
Creative theft in the entertainment   industry has become a forefront issue. Its
9
perpetrators   pillage the labor of lesser-known, hard-working  creators, while   unapologetically 10 exploiting  such work as exclusively their own_ The   flagrant   pilfering of the creative  victims
11
intellectual property is no more alive than in the music industry where innocent songwriters, artists, 12 and producers are routinely left as collateral damage. This is such a case.
13
2
The instant case involves blatant misrepresentations by Phora (acting on behalf of
14
Defendants)  followed and combined with the intentional and unauthorized forgery, duplication, 15 copying, andlor 'replication of Eskupe's signatures intended to fraudulently transfer and hide the theft 16 of Eskupe's ownership, rights, and interests to the master recordings which Eskupe jointly created:
17
The theft includes but is not limited to, the right to share in the monies derived from the exploitation
18
of the jointly created music. Defendants through their unlawful acts have committed, contributed,
19
participated in, and/or reaped the benefits of the theft and fraudulent transfer: 20 3. Eskupe is a talented yet lesser-known musical producer and artist with over a decade 21 of experience amassing approximately one billion streams and views on streaming platforms on 22 songs, including music videos, that he produced and created 23 4 Between 2012 to the present; Eskupe has co-created approximately sixty-four (64)
24
tracks together with the artist Phora, many of which have achieved considerable popularity. Their 25 co-created collection of musical works is provided as Exhibit (6 A attached hereto Joint Works" )
26
5.
In part due to the popularity of the Joint Works, Warner signed Phora to a lucrative
27
record label deal in or around 2017.
28
2
COMPLAINT
Rather than sharing the benefits,  rights, and interests of being   joint owners; 2 Defendants concocted a scheme to intentionally defraud Eskupe and usurp all of his ownership of
3
and rights to the Joint Works. Defendants intended to seize all rights, benefits, and interests of the
Joint Works for themselves while leaving Eskupe with nothing: 5 In furtherance of this scheme, Phora  and/or his representatives/agents   (acting on
behalf of Defendants) forged, copied, duplicated, and/or replicated Eskupe's signature and affixed it to two (2) separate Certificates of Employment as   well as a Producer   Agreement (collectively 8 ~Agreements") without Eskupe '$ consent 0 authorization. These fraudulently signed Agreements
9
effectively transferred all of Eskupe's rights, ownership, and interests in the Joint Works exclusively
10
to Phora and/or Warner.
11
8_
At all relevant times, Warner provided authority for Phora to act as its agent and has 12 allowed and benefitted, and will continue to benefit; from this scheme as the Agreements eliminate 13 the necessity for any clearances, shared profits, or credit to the Joint Works for anyone other than
14
Phora and/or Warner.
15
9
Further; at all relevant times herein; Warner failed to reasonably and appropriately 16 verify the accuracy and validity of the Agreements that Eskupe was alleged to have signed

24
25.
Following the success of the aforementioned projects, Phora signed a lucrative record
25
deal with Warner on November 2, 2016.
26
26.
In August 2017, Warner released Phora's debut album * Yours Truly Forever; which 27 Eskupe produced fifteen (15) of the sixteen (16) tracks including songs titled "God; 'R U Still," 28 'Facts; ~Way 2 Much; cSinner Pt. 2, (To The Moon;  'Forever; ) ) (Numb, ~Rider;"  Loyalty;'

5
28.
Throughout the creation of the Joint Works, to which Eskupe contributed substantial and  valuable contributions to, Eskupe and Phora   failed to execute a written   agreement: It was
understood by Eskupe and Phora that they were joint authors in the Joint Works and they intended to 8 own the Joint Works jointly and equally: 9 29. At no time has Eskupe authorized anyone to execute any agreement on his behalf that 10 determined or altered any of the ownership, rights, and interests in and/or to the Joint Works
11
B. Certificates of Employment 12 30. In or around 2017, Warner communicated with Phora and requested Eskupe's fees 13 and   royalty rates on Warner's   project (Run To_ Phora then intentionally, incorrectly, and 14 fraudulently informed Warner that Eskupe's "fees and royalty rates are both at 0.' Without verifying
15
this information with Eskupe, Warner emailed Phora a Certificate of Employment agreement, dated 16 March 16, 2017, and requested that Phora obtain Eskupe's signature and return the signed certificate
17
to Warner as soon as possible to send music out ASAP" By and through its words and conduct;
18
Warner authorized Phora to act as its agent.
19
31.
Following Warner's   request; Phora   intentionally   misrepresented to Jesus Rivera
20
(Rivera" ), Phora' s assistant and  agentlrepresentative at the time, that Eskupe's signature was 21 required by Warner for a basic "music video clearance" so that Phora and Warner had permission to
22
create a music video for the single  Run To" (Phora's Representation  ) Phora failed to inform
23
Rivera that Phora and/or Warner intended to usurp all of Eskupe's ownership, rights, and interests to
24
~Run To.
25
32.
Phora tasked Rivera to acquire Eskupe's signature. As instructed by Phora, Rivera 26 asked Eskupe for his signature and relayed Phora 's Representation to explain why it was needed 27 33_ Having been explained to and believing that his signature would be utilized for the 28 specific and limited purpose outlined in Phora'$ Representation, Eskupe texted his signature (the
COMPLAINT
"Signature") into a group chat: The group chat was comprised of Rivera, Phora, Anthony Ruiz p.k.a. 2 Anthro Beats, and Phora' s girlfriend at the time, Destiny Blakley (the 66 'Group Chat )_ In reliance on 3 Phora 's Representation, Eskupe 's Signature was provided for a very limited purpose.
4
34
Rather than for the intended purpose for which the Signature was provided, it was
5
later   discovered that the Signature was affixed to two   separate   agreements: (1) Certificate of Employment No. 1 dated March 16, 2017, (Certificate No. 12) (See Exhibit *B), and (2)
Certificate of Employment dated generally as August 2017 ("Certificate No. 2") (See Exhibit "C) 8 (collectively *Certificates')-
9
35.
Upon   inspection of the Certificates, Eskupe   recognized the   Signature on these 10 documents as the one he provided to the Group Chat pursuant to Phora's Representation. Phora did
11
not authorize the use of the Signature for the Certificates
12
36.
Before detecting the fraudulently signed Certificates, Eskupe never was approached 13 with the Certificates, he never saw nor reviewed the Certificates, the contents of the Certificates
14
were never discussed with him Or explained to him, nor did Eskupe sign nor authorize anyone to sign 15 the Certificates as written on his behalf
16
37.
Upon   information and belief, the Certificates were intentionally  concealed  from
17
Eskupe for some time to hide their fraudulent nature.
18
i.
Certificate No 1
19
38.
Certificate No. 1 is an agreement regarding the hit single titled "Run To;' whereby;
20
according to the certificate, Eskupe was purported to have agreed that rather than jointly owning the 21 master recording of "Run To; Eskupe would instead deem this master recording as:
22
'works made-for hire' and if not be a work-for-hire' then  Producer (Eskupe) hereby irrevocably grants, transfers, conveys and assigns to Company (Warner) the entirety of the rights, titles, and interests Producer has or may have. that Company is and shall be deemed the author and/or exclusive owner. throughout the world of all rights of any kind. thereby relinquishing his ownership and rights to the master recording of 'Run To.
23
24
25
26
39.
In OT around 2017, following Warner's request that Phora acquire Eskupe's signature 27 on Certificate No. 1, Phora represented to Rivera that Eskupe's signature was required for a music
28
video clearance for the song titled "Run To. Phora tasked Rivera to acquire Eskupe 's signature
COMPLAINT
based on Phora's Representation. Eskupe is informed and believes that Rivera did not read through 2 Certificate No. 1 and lacked awareness of its contents  Instead, Rivera relied solely on Phora's
3
Representation prior to requesting Eskupe's signature. 4 40_ Due to Phora's Representation, Rivera requested Eskupe's signature for the limited
5
purpose that Phora had described to him. Rivera explained to Eskupe that, as a joint author in the song 'Run To, his permission was required before Warner could film the music video. Based on
Phora's Representation, Rivera   further explained that the matter was urgent because Defendants
8
wanted to film a music video and get it out as soon as possible. Unbeknownst to Rivera at the time, rather than granting authorization to shoot the music video for "Run To;' Certificate No. 1 purported 10 to transfer all of Eskupe's ownership, rights, and interests in the jointly owned work exclusively to
11
Phora and/or Warner:
12
41_
In or around March 2017, Eskupe provided his Signature to Rivera via the Group 13 Chat for a limited purpose pursuant to Phora's Representation: At this time, Eskupe was unaware of 14 and did not authorize his signature for the broader use of transferring his entire ownership, rights,
15
and interests in the work
16
42.
Soon thereafter; upon information and belief, Rivera affixed the   Signature to
17
Certificate No 1 per Phora' $ instructions Eskupe was not provided with Certificate No 1 to review 18 prior to Rivera affixing the Signature to the document:
19
43_
The   effect of Certificate No. 1, among many things, was to deliver the master
20
recording of 'Run To" unencumbered to <Warner Bros Records (Record Company ) pursuant to 21 the recording agreement between Artist and Record Company dated November 2, 2016. 22 44_ Certificate No. L purported to grant the transfer of Eskupe's ownership and rights in
23
the song Run To;' in exchange for good and valuable consideration; the value of which was not 24 identified or specified in the document: Eskupe contends that he did not receive any consideration
25
with respect to Certificate No. 1 from Phora or Warner. Further; Eskupe is informed and believes 26 that   Defendants are   unable to verify the good and valuable consideration" that was allegedly 27 provided to Eskupe pursuant the language of Certificate No 1.
28
COMPLAINT
ii. Certificate No 2
2
45.
Certificate No. 2 is an agreement regarding the album titled <Yours Truly Forever; 3 whereby, pursuant to this document, Eskupe was purported to have agreed that rather than jointly owning eleven (11) of the master recordings o the project including; "God;' (R U Still; "Facts; 5 (Way 2 Much; 'Sinner Pt. 2, (To The Moon; 'Numb; "Rider;" "Loyalty;' 'No Looking Back; and < When It' s Over;  Eskupe would deem these master recordings as G6 works as made for hire
for Company (PE) 8 46_ Further; Certificate No. 2 states that "[clontributor (Eskupe) further acknowledges,
9
certifies and agrees that Company (PE) is and shall be deemed the author andlor exclusive owner of 10 all of the foregoing for all purposes and the exclusive owner throughout the world of all the rights
11
comprised in the copyright thereof: in perpetuity; and that "Contributor [Eskupe] did not make any 12 contributions to the underlying musical composition embodied in the Masters and is not entitled to a
13
claim in authorship and/or publishing interest stemming therefrom_ 14 47_ These master recordings   were to be 66 'delivered by Artist (Phora) to Warner Bros
15
Records pursuant to the recording agreement between Artist   (Phora) and the Record Company 16 (Warner) dated November 2, 20216.
17
48.
Essentially, Certificate No. 2 purported to relinquish Eskupe's interests, ownership, 18 and rights in the master recordings on the album " Yours Truly Forever; to Phora who was to then
19
deliver them to Warner unencumbered.
20
49_
Upon information and belief, between September 2017 and October 2017, Phora 's Of 21 Counsel at the time, Carron Mitchell and Phora's agent, Andrew Lieber, were pressuring Phora and 22 his team to acquire Eskupe's signature for Certificate No 2 at Warner' s request During this time, 23 Eskupe and Phora/Phora's team were not communicating:
24
50.
In o around October 14,2017, Phora instructed and pressured Rivera to use Eskupe's 25 Signature they already possessed and to affix it onto Certificate No. 2. Pursuant to Phora's orders;
26
Rivera forged, duplicated, copies, and/or replicated and affixed the Signature to Certificate No. 2 27 Eskupe is informed and believes that Rivera did not read through the contents of Certificate No. 2
28
prior to utilizing Eskupe' s signature as instructed to by Phora.
COMPLAINT
51_
Prior to Rivera utilizing Eskupe s signature on Certificate No. 2, Eskupe was not 2 provided with Certificate No. 2 to review, was completely unaware of its existence or contents, and
3
did not authorize the use ofhis signature.
4
52.
Outrageously, Certificate No. 2 purported to grant Phora and Warner, through PE,
5
sole and exclusive ownership of the master recordings o this album in exchange for 'good and valuable consideration in the amount of S1.0O. However, Eskupe contends that he did not receive any consideration with respect to Certificate No. 2. Further, Eskupe is informed and believes that 8 Defendants are unable to verify that any alleged consideration was provided to Eskupe pursuant the
9
language of Certificate No. 2. 10 53. Although Certificate No. 2 was dated generally in August 2017, Eskupe was first
11
provided with this agreement o April 26, 2023, after a representative of Eskupe demanded all
12
agreements concerning the album `Yours Truly Forever" from Warner:
13
C Producer Agreement
14
54
Equally, if not more peculiar, on or about September 14, 2022, Eskupe discovered for 15 the first time a non-dated Producer Agreement (Producer Agreement  ) allegedly entered into by
16 Eskupe and Phora. (See Exhibit *D) The Producer  Agreement was   first provided to Eskupe'$
17
representative via email through Phora's lawyer at the time, Matthew Buser; Esq , of Buser Legal. 18 55. Upon   inspection of the Producer Agreement;  Eskupe   immediately observed the
19
signature that was purported to be his, was in fact not his signature. Upon information and belief; the 20 signature appearing on the document is a blatant forgery, duplication, and/or replication of Eskupe'$ 21 signature. 22 56. This Producer Agreement stated that '[a]s of May 2nd 2017 Adrian Velasquez agrees 23 to grant Marco Archer (Phora) all exclusive rights, masters, and royalties for the songs he produced 24 during his time working for Phora. The agreement went o to state this agreement includes G6 all 25 production and co-production for Phoras albums With Love; 'Sincerely Yours; One Life To 26 Live, Angels With Broken Wings, cStill A Kid, 9) and cany other singles he produced for Phora 27 that were released before May 2nd 2017. Lastly, the   agreement   stated,  Phora   agrees to be
28
responsible for the clearing of all samples used on any of these songs.
10
COMPLAINT
57
Essentially, this document   relinquished all of Eskupe's   ownership,  rights, and 2 interests to Phora from every single Joint Work that was created by Phora and Eskupe -
3
58.
Interestingly, this short 6c agreement' failed to include any reference whatsoever to the
4
consideration that was allegedly exchanged for this transfer of rights. 5 59_ Prior to the Producer Agreement'$ discovery in 2022, Eskupe was never provided
with the Producer Agreement to review, was completely unaware of its existence or contents, and
7
did not authorize the use ofhis signature. 8 D Eskupe has Unequivocally Never Assigned his Copyrights, Intellectual Property, or
9
Royalties to Defendants
10
60.
Eskupe maintains he did not sign, nor did he authorize anyone to sign, the Certificates
11
and/or the Producer Agreement:
12
61_
Upon information and belief; the Signatures o the Certificates were fraudulently 13 affixed, forged, duplicated, copied, andlor replicated by Phora, acting on behalf of Warner, andlor 14 his agents/representatives without Eskupe's authorization Or consent:
15
62.
Upon information and belief; the signature on the Producer Agreement was
16
fraudulently affixed, forged, duplicated, and/or replicated by Phora, acting on behalf of Warner; 17 and/or his agents or representatives without Eskupe's authorization Or consent:
18
63
In all instances, Eskupe's signature was forged, duplicated, copied, and/or replicated 19 without Eskupe 's authorization or consent with the intent to deprive Eskupe of the ownership, rights,
20
and interests from the Joint Works, without limitation to the compensation derived thereof: 21 64_ Defendants benefited from these fraudulent acts to the detriment of Eskupe.
22
FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF
23
(Fraud and Deceit _ Intentional Misrepresentation As Against all Defendants and DOES 1-20)
24
65.
Eskupe incorporates herein and realleges the allegations in paragraphs L through 64 25 inclusive, as if set forth fully herein:
26
66
Eskupe alleges upon information and belief that at all relevant times herein, Warner 27 authorized Phora to act on its behalf:
28
11
COMPLAINT
67_
Eskupe alleges upon information and belief that Phora's Representation enumerated 2 above in Paragraph 31 was in fact, false.
3
68.
Upon information and belief; Rivera made Phora'$ Representation to Eskupe at the direction of Phora on behalf of all Defendants.
5
69.
Eskupe further alleges on information and belief that at the time Rivera made Phora'$ 6 Representation to Eskupe and at all relevant times alleged herein; Phora knew that such
representations were false in that, among other things, Phora intended to use Eskupe's signature and 8 replicate, duplicate, copy, and/or forge it onto documents including the Certificates and Producer
9
Agreement: 10 70. Eskupe further alleges o information and belief that Rivera made the representation 11 at the direction of Phora on behalf of all Defendants in an attempt to usurp Eskupe's ownership,
12 rights, and interests to the Joint Works for Warner and Phora Defendants: 71. At the time of Phora' s Representation; Eskupe was   ignorant of the falsity of the 13 representation and could not; in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have discovered the falsity of 14 such representations. 15 72. As a result of Phora's Representation, Eskupe provided his signature to Rivera, 16 Phora' s agent/representative, as requested for a limited  purpose   significantly exceeded by the 17 Certificates and Producer Agreement: 18 73 . Had Eskupe known the truth with respect to Phora's Representation, Eskupe would 19 not have provided his Signature to Rivera. Had Eskupe known that Phora intended to use a replicate, 20 duplicate, and/or  forge Eskupe's signature for other   documents   including the Certificates and 21 Producer Agreement; Eskupe would not have provided his Signature to Rivera. 22 74. As a direct and proximate result of Phora 's conduct o behalf of all Defendants, 23 Eskupe suffered damages and will continue to suffer damages according to proof at trial. 24 75_ The   aforementioned conduct by Phora, on behalf of all  Defendants and DOES 1 25 through 20, and each of them, was intentional and done to deprive Eskupe of property and/or legal 26 rights 0 otherwise causing injury, and was despicable conduct that subjected Eskupe to a cruel and 27 unjust hardship in conscious disregard of Eskupe's rights, to justify an award of exemplary and 28 punitive damages.

(Unjust Enrichment As Against All Defendants and DOES 1-20) 18 119. Eskupe incorporates herein and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 64, 19 inclusive, as if set forth fully herein: 20 120. As set forth above, Eskupe's assets including his ownership, rights, and interests in 21 the Joint Works have been fraudulently diverted as a result of the fraudulent conduct set forth herein
on behalf of all Defendants. 22 121. Eskupe is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Defendants retention of 23
24
Eskupe 's assets, and the profits the assets generated thereof, is wrongful and without basis 122. Based on the allegations set  forth herein and that under California law, one who 25 26 wrongfully obtains a thing is an involuntary trustee thereof, for the benefit of the owner (Eskupe). 27 Eskupe alleges on information and belief that one who gains a thing by fraud, accident; mistake, 28 undue influence, the violation of a trust, O other wrongful acts is, unless he o she has some other
17
COMPLAINT
and better right thereto, an involuntary trustee of the thing gained, for the person who would have
2
otherwise had it.
3
123 .
Under these provisions, Defendants hold Eskupe 's ownership, rights, and interests to the Joint Works wrongfully retained as described herein for the benefit of Eskupe. Retention of such 5 items by Defendants would result in their wrongful and unjust enrichment 6 124. Eskupe   is informed and  believed and thereon   alleges under   California   law, an equitable constructive trust may be imposed to prevent unjust enrichment where money has been 8 wrongfully acquired or detained Eskupe has a right to his portion of the ownership, rights, and interests of the Joint Works at issue, and Defendants do not.

18
However, Defendants have failed and refused and continue to fail and refuse to convey Eskupe's full 19 share of ownership, rights, and interests of the Joint Works, and profits derived therefrom; to the
20
detriment of Eskupe. On information and belief, Phora continues to wrongfully contend that Eskupe 21 is not entitled to such funds At all times herein mentioned, Eskupe was unaware, and could not have
22
discovered in the exercise of reasonable diligence, that Defendants intended to commit acts of fraud
23
as set forth herein:
24
128. Eskupe alleges o information and belief that Defendants conducted themselves as 25 described herein to improperly take advantage of Eskupe and to wrongfully acquire and maintain the 26 assets so that Defendants may wrongfully attempt to construct a claim as to ownership, rights, and
27
interests to the Joint Works and/or so they may attempt to retain profits obtained via the Joint Works
28
at Eskupe's expense.
18

As a result of Phora '$ Representation, Eskupe provided his signature to Rivera,
5
Phora' s   agentlrepresentative, as requested for a limited purpose   significantly  exceeded by the
6
Certificates and Producer Agreement.
140.
At the time of Phora's Representations, Phora and Warner  knew or  should have

10
Certificates and Producer Agreement to him

13 Eskupe has been deprived of the benefits of the ownership, rights, and interests of the Joint Works in
14
an amount to be proven at trial.
15
144.

Therefore, Eskupe is entitled to a   declaration that the Certificates and Producer
19
Agreement are rescinded and void ab initio. 20 146. Eskupe also is entitled to an Order demanding Defendants to return the appropriate 21 sums to Eskupe in connection with the monies earned through the exploitation of the Joint Works
22
from their inception: 23 147 . As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' actions, Eskupe has suffered and will
24
continue to suffer damages in an amount to be proven at trial but in no event less than this Court'$ 25 jurisdictional  minimum: In connection with the above-alleged conduct; Defendants are guilty of
26
oppression, fraud, and malice for the benefit of Defendants. Eskupe is therefore entitled to punitive 27 damages in an amount appropriate to punish and make an example of Defendants to the community. 28

Eskupe's consent or authorization. 150_ As a direct result of the aforementioned fraudulent conduct; Eskupe is informed and
10
believes that Defendants received money and profits from the exploitation of the Joint Works that 11 were intended to be allocated to Eskupe. 12 151. Eskupe did not receive any compensation or benefit from the exploitation of the Joint 13 Works that was intended to be allocated to Eskupe.
14
152.
Defendants have not given any just compensation or benefit from the exploitation of 15 the Joint Works to Eskupe. 16 153. Therefore,   Eskupe is entitled to his proportional share of all monies and 17 compensation derived from the Joint Works, plus prejudgment interest at the legal rate from the date 18 of filing this Complaint to the date of trial.

157. Eskupe incorporates herein and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 64, inclusive, as if set forth fully herein:
5
158.
An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Eskupe and Defendants 6 regarding the validity and enforceability of the Agreements. 159. Eskupe contends that Phora on behalf of all Defendants fraudulently attached, 8 replicated, duplicated, copied, and/or forged his signature to the Agreements, without Eskupe's consent or authorization; to transfer the entire ownership of the Joint Works exclusively to Phora 10 and/or Warner including but not limited to those for Warner's projects "Run To;' and <Yours Truly
11
Forever:
12
160.
Therefore, Eskupe contends that the Agreements are not and were never enforceable 13 and/or valid and is thus entitled to all ownership, benefits, rights, title, and interests of the Joint
14
Works
15
161.
Upon information and belief; Defendants deny Eskupe's contention that Phora
16
fraudulently transferred the ownership of the Joint Works and contend the Agreements are valid and
17
enforceable.
18
162. Eskupe now seeks a seeks a declaratory judgment from this Court that the Certificates 19 and Producer Agreement are declared to be rescinded and rendered void ab initio, Or in the
20
alternative, are declared unenforceable.
21
