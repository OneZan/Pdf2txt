GILBERT,  P.  J.*1116   It  has  been  said  that  some
contracts are not worth the paper they are written
on.  But  oral  contracts  stemming  from  previous
written  contracts  and 
long-standing  business
practices based on custom and trust are as valid as
contracts that are worth the paper they are written
on.  When  such  a  contract  is  breached,  there  are
consequences.

A  pepper  farmer  sued  the  manufacturer  of  a
pepper-based hot sauce for breach of contract and
fraud.  A  unanimous  jury  found  for  the  farmer,
awarding $13.3 million in compensatory damages
and  $10  million  in  punitive  damages.  We  affirm
the judgment.

FACTS

762

David  Tran  founded  Huy  Fong  Foods,  Inc.  (Huy
Fong),  a  business  that  produces  *762   Sriracha,  a
jalapeño  pepper-based  hot  sauce.  In  1988,  Huy
Fong  contracted  with  Underwood  Ranches,  L.P.
(Underwood)  to  purchase  500  tons  of  jalapeños
from  Underwood.  Craig  Underwood  (Craig)  is
Underwood's principal. This was the beginning of
a relationship that would last for 28 years.

1117

For the first 10 years, the parties executed written
agreements  specifying  the  price  per  pound  and
volume to be supplied. Thereafter, the parties dealt
with  each  other  informally  with  oral  agreements.
Originally,  Huy  Fong  needed  more  peppers  than
Underwood  could  supply,  so  it  contracted  with
other farmers as needed.

Underwood's  pepper  sales  to  Huy  Fong  grew
along  with  the  success  of  Huy  Fong's  business.
Craig  testified  that,  by  2005,  Tran  was  "pushing"
Underwood  to  add  more  acreage.*1117   In  2006,
Tran asked Underwood to significantly increase its
pepper  acreage.  Underwood  was  growing  95
percent  of  Huy  Fong's  peppers.  But  the  peppers
represented  only  25  percent  of  Underwood's
business.  Underwood  also  farmed  diverse  crops
such  as  lemons  and  vegetables.  Craig  told  Tran
that he was reluctant to assume the risk of growing
more  peppers,  and  rejected  Huy  Fong's  offer.
Craig  suggested 
that  Huy  Fong  supplement
Underwood's  crop  with  peppers  from  other
sources.

Instead  of  seeking  other  sources,  Huy  Fong
proposed  that  it  would  assume  some  of  the  risk.
Huy  Fong  would  pay  Underwood  by  the  acre
grown instead of pounds produced. Thus, the risk
of  a  disappointing  yield  would  be  on  Huy  Fong.
Underwood agreed to the arrangement.

In  2007,  Huy  Fong  advised  Underwood 
to
increase  its  acreage  by  50  percent.  To  do  this,
Underwood  had  to  expand  its  operations  from
Ventura  County  to  Kern  County.  Craig  testified
that  the  expansion  into  Kern  County  was  the
biggest  thing  he  had  ever  done,  but  he  needed  to
do it to meet Huy Fong's increasing needs.

At  the  same  time,  Huy  Fong  was  building  a
600,000-square-foot  factory  in  Irwindale.  Tran
took  Craig  on  a  tour  of  the  site.  Tran  told  Craig
that  Underwood  "needed  to  fill  it  up."  Tran  told
Craig  that  he  should  be  farming  at  least  2,000
acres.

Due  to  Tran's  suggestion  and  encouragement,
Underwood 
in
acquiring additional acres in Kern County and, to
a lesser extent, Ventura County. By the end of the
2016  growing  season,  Underwood  had  acquired
over 1,800 acres in Kern County. It took a year or
more  to  prepare  the  ground  for  growing  peppers.
Many  of  the  leases  extended  into  the  2020's,
2030's,  and  beyond.  By  2016,  Huy  Fong
accounted  for  approximately  80  percent  of
Underwood's revenue.

and  Tran's 

Underwood made these investments because Tran
and  Donna  Lam,  Huy  Fong's  chief  operations
officer 
assured
Underwood  that  Huy  Fong  would  continue  to
purchase  the  peppers  grown  by  Underwood  into
the future. Craig testified Tran and Lam made sure
he  knew  Huy  Fong  was  going  to  take  all  the
product  Underwood  would  produce.  They
repeatedly told Craig, "You grow it, I'll sell it."

Craig,  along  with  Underwood's  chief  operations

Chilico, LLC

In 2014 or 2015, Tran formed a new company that
he  later  called  Chilico,  LLC.  Chilico's  purpose
was to obtain peppers for Huy Fong. In May 2015,
Tran  offered  Roberts  a  job.  Roberts  declined  the
job offer and attributed the offer to a mistake.

2

Huy Fong Foods, Inc. v. Underwood Ranches, LP     66 Cal.App.5th 1112 (Cal. Ct. App. 2021)

Tran  officially  formed  Chilico  in  2016.  He  gave
100  percent  ownership  to  his  sister-in-law  Lam.
Tran  testified  that  he  wanted  to  give  Lam  a
significant  salary  increase,  but  his  son  and  wife,
who were on Huy Fong's board, would object.

Huy  Fong  contracted  with  Chilico  to  buy  all  its
chilies  peppers 
from  Chilico.  The  contract
diverted  millions  of  dollars  from  Huy  Fong  to
Chilico.

2017 Contract

On  November  1,  2016,  Craig,  Roberts,  Tran,  and
Lam  met  at  the  Huy  Fong  factory  to  plan  for  the
2017  pepper  season.  The  parties  discussed
ongoing  field  preparations  for  the  upcoming
season.  Underwood  was  already  preparing  the
ground.  Because  it  is  a  continuous  process,
Underwood could not wait.

Underwood  and  Huy  Fong  agreed  that  for  the
2017  season  Underwood  would  plant  1,700  acres
for $13,000 per acre. Tran also agreed to advance
payments of $18 million.

Breach of Contract

On  November  9,  2016,  Lam  asked  Roberts  to
come  to  the  Huy  Fong  factory  to  pick  up  some
equipment.  Lam  and  Tran  knew  Craig  was  on
vacation and would not accompany Roberts.

1119

When  Roberts  arrived,  Tran  told  him  that  he  was
forming  a  new  company.  Lam  was  going  to
operate  the  company.  Tran  told  Roberts  that
Roberts  would  be  working  for  the  new  company.
*1119   When  Roberts  declined  the  job  offer,  Tran
was not happy. Tran told Roberts that Underwood
would have to deliver peppers for $500 per ton to
compete  with  Chinese  pepper  mash  that  sold  for
$300  per  ton.  When  Roberts  told  Tran  that  Craig
makes  the  decisions  for  Underwood,  Tran  replied
that he would make Craig take $500 per ton.

facing 

Further  negotiations  with  Huy  Fong  proved
unfruitful.  Lam  insisted  that  Huy  Fong  needed  to
purchase  peppers  for  under  $500  per  ton.  Tran
refused  to  provide  Underwood  with  prepayments
needed to finance the crop. Tran also insisted that
Underwood contract with Chilico rather than Huy
Fong.  Chilico  did  not  have  the  assets  to  ensure
that  Underwood  would  be  paid  and  Huy  Fong
refused to guarantee the Chilico contract.

Tran  made  a  final  attempt  to  hire  Roberts  away
from Underwood.

In  early  January  2017,  Craig  sent  an  e-mail  to
Tran  stating  that  in  October  2016  they  had  an
agreement  to  move  ahead  with  production  for
2017;  subsequently,  Huy  Fong  decided  to  change
the agreement; and it is impossible for Underwood
to  comply  with  the  modified  terms.  The  e-mail
advised  Huy  Fong  that  the  start  date  for  *764
planting  had  passed,  there  were  no  plants  in  the
nursery,  and  Underwood  did  not  plan  on
delivering any peppers to Huy Fong.

764

Huy  Fong  contracted  with  other  farmers  to
provide  peppers.  Tran  showed  those  farmers  the
drone video of Underwood's 2016 harvest that he
had  promised  to  keep  confidential  to  show  them
how to harvest economically.

Consequences of Huy Fong's Breach

After  the  relationship  with  Huy  Fong  ended,
Underwood  had  nothing  to  plant  on  the  1,700
acres  it  had.  Nor  did  Underwood  have  the
financing  to  plant  acreage  on  speculation.  It  tried
to  get  out  of

Roberts  explained  that  with  two  or  three  years’
notice, Underwood could have avoided the losses.
He  testified:  "[W]e  would  have  compressed  the 
*1120   acreage  on  the  peppers.  We  wouldn't  have
worried  about  the  [crop]  rotation.  I  could  have
shed property at the same time as growing peppers
and  generated  revenue  from  those.  It  would  have
given  me–that  entire  first  year  when  we  had
absolutely nothing to grow, that would have been
covered.  So,  that  massive  loss  in  the  first  year
would  have  been  eliminated.  And  in  the  second
year, we would be taking on new customers. Then
if  we  could  work  it  out,  reduce  our  pepper  acres,
add  the  new  acres  of  other  crops,  it  might  have
been seamless. Might not have had any loss."

Roberts  testified  that  growing  peppers  for  Huy
Fong required planning three years ahead of time.

Procedure

Huy  Fong  brought  an  action  against  Underwood
seeking  a  $1.4  million  refund  of  payments  Huy
Fong had made for the 2016 season.

on breach of contract and fraud. The jury awarded
Underwood  $13.32  million

In  Norkin  ,  plaintiff  made  a  claim  against  his

refused  to  renew  the  policy.  Plaintiff  brought  an
action  for  fraud  against  the  insurer  alleging  the
insurer  failed  to  disclose  it  would  not  do  further
business  with  plaintiff  if  he  made  a  claim.  The
trial court sustained the insurer's demurrer without
leave  to  amend.  The  Court  of  Appel  affirmed,
stating  the  insurer  was  under  no  duty  to  disclose
its intention not to renew. ( Norkin v. United States
Fire  Ins.  Co.  ,  supra  ,  237  Cal.App.2d  at  p.  438,
47 Cal.Rptr. 15.)

Underwood's  theory  is  not  that  every  contract
requires  a  party  to  disclose  an  intention  not  to
renew.  Instead,  Underwood's  theory  is  that  Huy
Fong  induced  Underwood  to  acquire  more  and
more  land  by  continually  promising  Underwood
that  Huy  Fong  would  purchase  all  the  peppers
Underwood  produced.  Huy  Fong  understood  that
it  was  inducing  Underwood  to  commit  itself  into
the  future,  while  at  the  same  time  concealing  its
plan to terminate its relationship with Underwood.

Huy Fong Foods, Inc. v. Underwood Ranches, LP     66 Cal.App.5th 1112 (Cal. Ct. App. 2021)

Had  the  insurer  in  Norkin  induced  plaintiff  to
purchase his house on the fraudulent promise that
it would continue to insure it, we are confident the
result would have been different.

More  to  the  point,  the  question  on  appeal  is  not
whether  the  judgment  can  be  upheld  on  a
particular  legal  theory,  but  whether  the  judgment
can  be  upheld  on  any  legal  theory.  (See,  e.g.,
International etc. Workers v. Landowitz (1942) 20
Cal.2d 418, 423, 126 P.2d 609  [judgment  entered
on  grounds  that  ordinance  is  unconstitutional
upheld on other grounds].)

(a) Fraudulent Concealment

Huy Fong contends it had no duty to disclose that
it  did  not  intend  to  continue  its  contractual
relationship with Underwood

1122

Fraudulent concealment requires the "suppression
of  a  fact,  by  one  who  is  bound  to  disclose  it."  (
Civ.  Code,  §  1710,  subd.  3.)  Plaintiff  must  *1122
show  that  defendant  had  a  duty  to  disclose.  (
Linear  Technology  Corp.  v.  Applied  Materials,
Inc.  (2007)  152  Cal.App.4th  115,  131,  61
Cal.Rptr.3d 221.)

A  duty  to  disclose  may  arise  from  a  confidential
relationship.  Where  there  exists  a  relationship  of
trust and confidence, it is the duty of one in whom
the confidence is reposed to make a full disclosure
of all material facts within his knowledge relating
to the transaction in question and any concealment
of  a  material  fact  is  a  fraud.  (  Estate  of  Sanders
(1985) 40 Cal.3d 607, 616, 221 Cal.Rptr. 432, 710
P.2d  232.)  A  confidential  relationship  can  exist
is  no
even 
fiduciary relationship. ( Id. at p. 615, 221 Cal.Rptr.
432,  710  P.2d  232.)  A  confidential  relationship
may  be  founded  on  moral,  social,  domestic,  or
merely  a  personal  relationship.  (  *766  Barbara A.
v. John G . (1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 369, 382, 193
Cal.Rptr. 422.)

though,  strictly  speaking, 

there 

In  Bank  of  America  v.  Sanchez  (1934)  3
Cal.App.2d  238,  243,  38  P.2d  787,  the  court
stated,  "[I]t  is  sufficient  to  show  the  existence  of

766

1123

such  friendly  relations  during  a  period  of  several
years  between  the  parties  as  would  entitle  the
injured person to place confidence in the integrity
and  honesty  of  the  other  party  to  a  contract  ...."
The  court  determined  that  a  customer's  business
relationship with a bank over a period of years, her
husband's  former  employment  with  the  bank,  and
her  acquaintance  with  and  confidence  in  officers
of  the  bank  were  substantial  evidence  of  a
confidential relationship. ( Ibid. )

Here  the  parties’  relationship  extended  over  28
years.  Tran  testified  his  relationship  with  Craig
was  like  a  family,  that  he  trusted  Craig,  and  saw
him  as  a  good  friend.  Lam  described 
the
relationship between Underwood and Huy Fong as
a  "concrete  bond."  The  parties  shared  financial
information. Craig obtained more land in reliance
on  Huy  Fong's  assurance  that  it  would  buy  what
the  most
produced.  Perhaps 
Underwood 
compelling evidence of a confidential relationship
is  that  for  many  years  the  parties  entered  into
transactions  involving  tens  of  millions  of  dollars
without formal written contracts.

Huy  Fong  points  out  that  the  jury  was  instructed
on fraudulent concealment, but the instruction did
not include confidential relationship.

that 

the  parties 

If  this  was  error,  it  is  patently  harmless.  The
evidence that Underwood and Huy Fong were in a
confidential  relationship  is  overwhelming.  Even
Huy  Fong  concedes  in  its  opening  brief  that  the
parties  had  enjoyed  a  "close  and  friendly"
relationship, 
"successfully
collaborated  for  decades,"  that  the  relationship
grew less formal as the parties "drew closer," and
that they "shared the financial burdens and risks of
jalapeño  cultivation."  Huy  Fong  does  not  even
suggest  any  contrary  evidence.*1123   Huy  Fong
argues the concealed information must be fact not
intention.  But  again  the  authority  Huy  Fong  cites
does  not  support  the  argument.  The  cases  Huy
Fong  cites  do  involve  a  concealment  of  fact  but
none  of  them  hold  a  concealment  of  intention  is
not  sufficient.  (See,  e.g.,  Hoffman  v.  162  North

(b) Affirmative Misrepresentation

Huy  Fong  contends  there  is  no  evidence  of  an
affirmative misrepresentation.

In  viewing  the  evidence,  we  look  only  to  the
evidence  supporting  the  prevailing  party.  (  GHK
Associates  v  Mayer  Group,  Inc  .  (1990)  224
Cal.App.3d  856,  872,  274  Cal.Rptr.  168.)  We
discard  evidence  unfavorable  to  the  prevailing
party as not having sufficient verity to be accepted
by the trier of fact. ( Ibid. ) Where the trial court or
jury  has  drawn  reasonable  inferences  from  the
evidence, we have no *767  power to draw different
inferences,  even  though  different  inferences  may
also  be  reasonable.  (  McIntyre  v.  Doe  &  Roe
(1954)  125  Cal.App.2d  285,  287,  270  P.2d  21.)
The  trier  of  fact  is  not  required  to  believe  even
uncontradicted  testimony.  (  Sprague  v.  Equifax,
Inc.  (1985)  166  Cal.App.3d  1012,  1028,  213
Cal.Rptr. 69.)

One who willfully deceives another with intent to
induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk
is liable for any damage that he thereby suffers. (
Civ.  Code,  §  1709.)  A  promise  to  do  something
necessarily implies an intention to perform; hence,
when a promise is made without such an intention,
it  is  fraud.  (  Lazar  v.  Superior  Court  (1996)  12
Cal.4th  631,  638,  49  Cal.Rptr.2d  377,  909  P.2d
981.)

1124

that 

Huy  Fong  points  out 
the  only  fraud
Underwood alleges in its complaint is a July 2016
representation  that  Huy  Fong  would  purchase
peppers  from  Underwood  for  the  2017,  2018,
2019  pepper  seasons  and  beyond.  Huy  Fong
argues  that  at  best  there  was  an  implied  promise
based  on  vague  reassurances  of  good  feelings
between  the  parties.  Huy  Fong  cites  *1124  Lonely
Maiden  Productions,  LLC  v.  Golden  Tree  Asset
Management,  LP  (2011)  201  Cal.App.4th  368,
375,  135  Cal.Rptr.3d  69,  for  the  proposition  that
California does not recognize a fraud claim based
on an implied false promise.

But  Lonely  Maiden  cites  no  authority  for  the
proposition  that  fraud  cannot  be  based  on  an
implied false promise. Where the implied promise
is  certain  enough  to  cause  reasonable  reliance,
there  is  no  reason  it  cannot  be  a  proper  basis  for
fraud.  Parties  may  not  avoid  liability  for  fraud
simply  because  they  leave  to  implication  what
they clearly intend to communicate.

In  any  event,  here  there  was  far  more  than  an
implied  promise  based  on  vague  reassurances  of
good  feelings  between  the  parties.  Huy  Fong
expressly  told  Underwood  numerous  times  that
Huy  Fong  would  purchase  all 
the  peppers
Underwood  could  produce.  These  promises  were
made in the context of Huy Fong's insistence that
Underwood  obtain  more  land,  a  matter  that

The jury could reasonably conclude that Huy Fong
had  no  intention  of  keeping  those  promises  when
they  were  made.  There  is  evidence  to  show  that
Tran  had  long  planned  to  cut  Huy  Fong's  ties  to
Underwood.  As  far  back  as  2014,  Tran  was
planning  to  form  Chilico,  a  company  that  would

interest  in  harvest  operations,  used  a  drone  to
video Underwood's harvest. After he cut ties with
Underwood,  he  used  the  video  to  show  other

Alleged Inconsistent Jury Findings

following  questions: 

Huy  Fong  contends  the  jury  made  inconsistent
findings on the parties’ contract.*768  On the jury's
special verdict form, the jury answered yes to both
the 
"Did  Underwood
Ranches LP and Huy Fong Foods, Inc. *1125  enter
into  an  ongoing  contract  (something  more  than
annual  contracts)  whereby  Underwood  Ranches
would  grow  jalapeño  peppers  for  Huy  Fong?"
"Did  Underwood  Ranches  LP  and  Huy  Fong
Foods,  Inc.  enter  into  a  contract  for  the  2017
jalapeño pepper growing season?"

A  special  verdict  is  inconsistent  if  there  is  no
possibility  of  reconciling  its  findings  with  each
other.  (  Singh  v.  Southland  Stone  U.S.A.,  Inc.
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 338, 357, 112 Cal.Rptr.3d
455.)

Here  the  jury's  findings  are  consistent  and  easily
reconciled.  Read  together,  the  jury  found  that  the
parties  had  an  ongoing  contractual  relationship
that included the 2017 jalapeño growing season.

Motion for New Trial

Huy  Fong  contends  the  trial  court  abdicated  its
responsibility to sit as a 13th juror in ruling on its
motion for a new trial.

Huy  Fong  made  a  motion  for  a  new  trial  on  the
ground  of  insufficiency  of  the  evidence  to  justify
the verdict. ( Code Civ. Proc., § 657, subd. 6.)

Code  of  Civil  Procedure  section  657  provides,  in
part:  "A  new  trial  shall  not  be  granted  upon  the
ground  of  insufficiency  of  the  evidence  to  justify
the  verdict  or  other  decision  ...  unless  after
weighing the evidence the court is convinced from
the  entire  record,  including  reasonable  inferences
therefrom,  that  the  court  or  jury  clearly  should
have  reached  a  different  verdict  or  decision."
(Italics added.)

its  duty 

that 
the

trial  court
Huy  Fong's  contention 
abdicated 
the  court's
statement:  "I  may  be  the  13th  juror,  but  I  don't
view  myself  as  the  super  juror  where,  because  I
disagree  with  what  the  jury  has  returned  in  the
way of a verdict, I can just, you know, run over the
top  of  it  and  substitute  my  personal  opinion  for
theirs."

Huy Fong apparently believes the trial court does
have  the  power  to  substitute  the  court's  personal
opinion  for  that  of  the  jury.  Huy  Fong  relies  on
Ryan v. Crown Castle NG Networks, Inc. (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th  775,  211  Cal.Rptr.3d  743.  In  Ryan  ,
the  Court  of  Appeal  reversed  the  trial  court's
denial  of  the  plaintiff's  motion  for  a  new  trial  on
the  ground  of  inadequate  damages  because  the
trial court implied it had no power to question the
adequacy of the jury's award and because the trial
court  did  not  evaluate  the  evidence.  (  Id.  at  pp.
783-786, 211 Cal.Rptr.3d 743.)*1126   But  here  the
trial court evaluated the evidence and did not say
it had no power to question the jury's verdict. The
court  said  it  had  no  power  to  act  as  a  super  juror
and  substitute  its  personal  opinion  for  that  of  the
jurors.  That  is  a  correct  statement  of  the  law  and
reflects  how  all  judges  are  duty  bound  to  act.  To
do  otherwise  would  impoverish  our  system  of
justice.

Underwood  has  a  constitutional  right  to  a  jury
trial.  (  Cal.  Const.,  art  I,  §  16.)  Code  of  Civil
Procedure section 657 empowers the trial court to
grant  a  new  trial  only  when  after  independently
evaluating  the  evidence  the  court  concludes  the
jury's verdict is "clearly" wrong. The court cannot
grant  a  new  trial  simply  because  it  would  have
found  differently  than  the  jury.  (  Dominguez  v.
Pantalone  (1989)  212  Cal.App.3d  201,  216,  260
Cal.Rptr.  431.)  That  is  what  the  trial  court  said.
*769   The  purpose  of  Code  of  Civil  Procedure
section 657 is not to give the trial court permission
to run roughshod over a party's constitutional right
to  jury  determination.  Instead,  the  purpose  is  to

IV

Punitive Damages

Huy Foods contends that the $10 million punitive
damage award must be vacated.

Huy Fong argues that punitive damages cannot be
awarded  for  breach  of  contract  in  the  absence  of
an  independent  tort.  But  here  punitive  damages
were  awarded  for  fraud,  not  breach  of  contract.
Punitive damages may be awarded for fraud even
though  the  fraud  incidentally  involves  breach  of
contract.  (See  Schroeder  v.  Auto  Driveaway  Co.
(1974) 11 Cal.3d 908, 921, 114 Cal.Rptr. 622, 523
P.2d 662  [defendants  who  contracted  to  transport
plaintiffs’  goods  are  liable  for  punitive  damages
for 
they  were  not

by 
Commission to transport goods].)

Huy Fong's reliance on Applied  Equipment  Corp.
v. Litton Saudi Arabia, Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503,
is
516,  28  Cal.Rptr.2d  475,  869  P.2d  454, 
misplaced.  In  that  case  our  Supreme  Court  held
that  a  party  cannot  be  liable  for  conspiracy  to

1127

interfere with its own contract. This case involves
fraud,  not  *1127   interference  with  contract.  If  a
party  could  interfere  with  its  own  contract,  every
breach of contract would be a tort. But not every
breach of contract involves fraud.

Huy  Fong  argues  that  punitive  damages  were  not
proven  by  clear  and  convincing  evidence.  (  Civ.
Code,  §  3294,  subd.  (a)  [to  recover  punitive
damages,  fraud  must  be  proven  by  clear  and
convincing  evidence].)  But  the  jury  unanimously
found fraud by clear and convincing evidence. We
stated the evidence that supports a finding of fraud
by  affirmative  misrepresentation  and  fraudulent
concealment.  We  viewed  the  record  as  a  whole
and determine that the record contains substantial
evidence  from  which  a  reasonable  trier  of  fact
could  have  made 
the  high
probability demanded by the clear and convincing
evidence  standard.  (  Conservatorship  of  O.B.
(2020) 9 Cal.5th 989, 1005, 266 Cal.Rptr.3d 329,
470 P.3d 41.)

the  finding  of 

Finally, Huy Fong argues the $10 million punitive
damages  award  was  so  excessive  as  to  violate
federal  due  process.  The  United  States  Supreme
Court has set forth three guideposts for reviewing
a  punitive  damages  award:  "(1)  the  degree  of
reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct; (2)
the disparity between the actual or potential harm
suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages
award; and (3) the difference between the punitive
damages  awarded  by  the  jury  and  the  civil
penalties  authorized  or  imposed  in  comparable
cases." ( State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance
Co.  v.  Campbell  (2003)  538  U.S.  408,  418,  123
S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585.)

770

Concerning the first guidepost, the Supreme Court
stated:  "  ‘[T]he  most  important  indicium  of  the
reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the
degree  of  *770   reprehensibility  of  the  defendant's
conduct.’  [Citation.]  We  have  instructed  courts  to
determine  the  reprehensibility  of  a  defendant  by
considering  whether: 
the  harm  caused  was
physical  as  opposed  to  economic;  the  tortious

1128

conduct  evinced  an  indifference  to  or  a  reckless
disregard  of  the  health  or  safety  of  others;  the
target  of  the  conduct  had  financial  vulnerability;
the  conduct  involved  repeated  actions  or  was  an
isolated  incident;  and  the  harm  was  the  result  of
intentional  malice,  trickery,  or  deceit,  or  mere
accident."  (  State  Farm  Mutual  Automobile
Insurance Co. v. Campbell , supra , 538 U.S. at p.
419, 123 S.Ct. 1513.)

vulnerable.  Almost 

Concerning  the  first  guidepost,  the  degree  of
reprehensibility, 
that  Huy  Fong's
fraudulent  conduct  did  not  directly  physically
harm  anyone.  But  in  addition  to  the  mental
distress  Craig  felt,  40  people  lost  their  jobs.  The
harm  done  by  Huy  Fong's  deception  was  not
limited  to  Craig.  The  emotional  distress  and  loss
of  jobs  were  entirely  foreseeable.  Huy  Fong
simply  did  not  care.  In  addition,  Underwood  was
of
particularly 
Underwood's  production  was  devoted  to  Huy
Fong.  Huy  Fong  encouraged  *1128   Underwood's
dependence by demanding that Underwood obtain
more  acreage  and  by  promising  to  buy  all  that
Underwood  produced.  Even 
if  Huy  Fong's
deception  may  be  described  as  a  single  incident,
Huy  Fong  had  been  planning  the  deception  for
some  period  of  time.  It  did  not  occur  in  an
aberrant moment. Finally, the harm was the result
of  intentional  deceit,  not  a  mere  accident.  The
degree  of  reprehensibility  is  more  than  sufficient
to support the punitive damages award.

all 

The  second  guidepost,  the  disparity  between  the
actual harm and the punitive damages award, also
favors  affirming  the  award.  The  United  States
Supreme Court has refused to draw a bright line. (
Simon v. San Paolo U.S. Holding Co., Inc . (2005)
35  Cal.4th  1159,  1181,  29  Cal.Rptr.3d  379,  113
P.3d 63.) But few awards exceeding a single-digit
ratio between punitive and compensatory damages
will  satisfy  due  process.  (  State  Farm  Mutual
Automobile  Insurance  Co.  v.  Campbell  ,  supra  ,
538 U.S. at p. 425, 123 S.Ct. 1513.) Past decisions
approving  ratios  of  three-  or  four-to-one  are
"instructive." ( Ibid. )

the  ratio  of  punitive 

Here 
to  compensatory
damages  is  0.75-to-one.  Even  if  we  were  to
consider  the  reprehensibility  factor  to  be  in  the
middle  range,  the  low  punitive  to  compensatory
damages ratio supports the award.

Finally,  the  third  guidepost  is  the  difference
between the punitive damages award and the civil
penalties  authorized  or  imposed  in  comparable
cases. Our Supreme Court has noted that the third
guidepost  is  less  useful  in  a  case  like  this  where
plaintiff  prevailed  only  on  a  cause  of  action
involving common law tort duties that do not lend
themselves to comparison with statutory penalties.
( Simon v. San Paolo U.S. Holding Co., Inc. supra
, 35 Cal.4th at pp. 1184-1185, 29 Cal.Rptr.3d 379,
113  P.3d  63.)  Nevertheless,  "we  do  note  that
California  [statutes]  typically  impose[  ]  treble
damages  penalties  for  fraudulent  and  bad  faith
(2004)  119
conduct." 
Cal.App.4th  1,  24,  14  Cal.Rptr.3d  89.)  There  is
nothing  about  statutory  penalties  that  indicates  a
0.75-to-one  ratio  of  punitive  to  compensatory
damages is excessive. Far from it. Here the award
of punitive damages is low.
